# 📄 DocuBotX – AI PDF Question Answering App

DocuBotX is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload a PDF and ask questions based on its content. It leverages **LangChain**, **Hugging Face models**, and **Streamlit** to provide intelligent, context-aware answers from documents.  

This is a solo project developed by **Aakriti Garkoti** as part of an advanced portfolio to showcase skills in **AI/ML, NLP, and app deployment**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docubotx-pdf-ai-app.git
cd docubotx-pdf-ai-app
2️⃣ Install the Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually install the core packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit langchain huggingface_hub PyMuPDF faiss-cpu
3️⃣ Add Your Hugging Face API Token
To access the model from HuggingFace:

Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

Create a new token (read access)

Add it as an environment variable:

bash
Copy code
set HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here   # Windows
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here  # Mac/Linux
4️⃣ Run the App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run docubotx.py
Then open http://localhost:8501/ in your browser.

📂 File Structure
bash
Copy code
docubotx-pdf-ai-app/
│
├── docubotx.py             # Main Streamlit app code
├── requirements.txt        # List of required Python packages
├── sample.pdf              # (Optional) Sample test PDF
└── README.md               # You're reading it!
🧠 How It Works
User uploads a PDF

App extracts and chunks the text

Text is embedded using HuggingFace model

A vector index is created using FAISS

When a question is asked, the app retrieves the most relevant chunks

The HuggingFace model generates a response based on the context
